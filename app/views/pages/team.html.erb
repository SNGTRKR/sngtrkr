<div class="team-desc right"><div class="font-15"><strong>Billy Dallimore (Co-Founder, Chief Designer)</strong></div><br/>
Billy was brought up within a family run Graphic Design business from an early age, which in turn inspired him to turn to web design &amp; development. 
Being self taught amongst several web languages from the early age of 16, Billy has reaffirmed, improved and certified his skills within the web development 
&amp; design business over the course of 6 years. Billy also shares a passion for the EDM music scene, and has been actively DJing anything with a bassline for the past couple of years.</div>

<p>
Matt has been using a keyboard and mouse since he was 4, or so his university application says anyway. Like Tom he taught himself web development from an early age, and
went on to study Computer Science at Bristol University. He's in his 2nd year right now. When not busy with deadlines and general hackery, he enjoys DJing a
variety of music.
